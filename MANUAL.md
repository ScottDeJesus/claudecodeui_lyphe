## MAN-7401 — The Claude update check

The read half of the Claude Code / Agent SDK update pipeline: `GET /api/claude-updates` and
`POST /api/claude-updates/check`, both behind `authenticateToken`, mounted in `server/index.ts`
right after `/api/system`. `createClaudeUpdatesModule({ appRoot, supervised, isListening,
requestReboot, onRebootFailed })` (`claude-updates.module.ts`) builds `{ router, start, stop,
startReconciler }`; the entrypoint wires `start()` after `listen` (the first tick writes a file and
asks the registry — a boot that never gets there does neither), `stop()` on shutdown (a check
already in flight is left to finish), and `startReconciler()` as the last of `soleServerDuties` — a
job is picked up only once a server is serving. The reboot channel is `supervised-boot.ts`'s own
(`requestReboot` / `onRebootFailed`), so both sides of a handover use one voice.

```json
{ "checkedAt": 1790632555421, "checking": false, "checkError": null, "nextCheckAt": 1790634355421,

```

`ClaudeUpdatesReport` / `ClaudeUpdatePackage` and the rest of the wire contract are declared under
`CLAUDE UPDATE CONTRACTS` in `server/shared/claude-update-types.ts`, mirrored field for field in
`src/shared/claude-update-types.ts` — read them there, not a copy here.

**The five files of the check half, one question each:**

| file | owns |
|---|---|
| `update-check.store.ts` | `check.json`'s shape: read once at service build, written atomically (temp file + rename) after every check |
| `update-check.reader.ts` | one package's world-read — `npm view <name> dist-tags.latest --json` (30 s ceiling; npm itself is capped to 10 s / 0 retries via `npm_config_fetch_*` env so its own error text beats the kill) — plus the changelog fetch and the re-read trigger |
| `changelog.ts` | `fetchChangelog` / `parseChangelog` / `notesBetween` over the two `CHANGELOG.md` files, sectioned on `## x.y.z` |
| `update-check.report.ts` | the report's composition: `installed`/`loaded`/`latest` never inferred from one another; `updateAvailable` and `notesReason` decided here |
| `update-check.service.ts` | the cadence (a tick every 5 min, a check every 30 min, first tick 5 s after `start()`), `checkNow()` (joins an in-flight check, never rejects), the one journal line per check |

**Rules:**
- A failed registry read keeps the last-good `latest` and stores the failure in `latestError` (per
  package) / `checkError` and the journal line (per attempt) — a lost read is never a lost `check.json`.
- The changelog window is `(windowFrom, latest]`, re-read only when `latest` moved, the install fell
  BELOW its stored `windowFrom` (a rollback — the one direction a stored window can be too narrow),
  or an update is on offer the stored notes don't reach yet. An install that moved *up* never
  triggers a re-read: the stored set is then wider than needed and the report narrows it.
- `notesReasonFor` tests the floor (`windowFrom` above the install) before the "no entry yet" line,
  else a window that starts too high reads as a changelog with no entry for a release it was never
  asked to cover.
- A `checkedAt` in the future (a clock stepped back) is read as no check at all, on disk
  (`readStoredCheck`) and in memory (`checkIfDue`'s negative-gap branch); both re-check, and
  checking re-stamps.
- The CLI's `installed` is the one cached reading `readInstalledCliVersion()`
  (`@/modules/cli-version/index.js`) answers — the same reading `/api/cli-version` and the chat
  runtime's retirement decision use (MAN-501; MAN-502 rule 1). This module resolves no binary of
  its own.
- `isBehindInstalled` (`server/shared/version-order.ts`) is the one ordering rule behind every
  version comparison here — the changelog window, `updateAvailable`, the short-window test, the
  reader's re-read trigger — the same rule MAN-502 describes for the chat runtime and the idle sweep.

**Out of scope for this row:** the job — `ClaudeUpdateJob` and the install/restart half — is
MAN-7402 (the detached runner: `update-job.ts`, `update-runner.ts`) and MAN-7403 (the API side that
starts, watches and commits it: `update-actions.service.ts`, `update-reconciler.ts` with its
`.states`, `update-commit.ts`, the `POST /apply` and `POST /restart` routes).
`claude-updates.module.ts` reads `job.json` and the last 40 lines of its log into every report
(`currentJob()`) but owns none of the job's own behavior.

governs: /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/index.ts, /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/modules/claude-updates/, /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/shared/claude-update-types.ts, /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/shared/version-order.ts

## MAN-7402 — The Claude update runner — install and rollback

The install/restart half of the Claude Code / Agent SDK update pipeline (the read half — the
version check — is MAN-7401): a DETACHED runner process that outlives the API process that
requested the update. Three files, one question each:

| file | owns |
|---|---|
| `update-job.ts` | `job.json`/`job.log` under `claudeUpdatesDir()`; `createJob`/`readJob`/`writeJob` (temp-file + rename, never a half-written read); `spawnUpdateRunner(appRoot, dir, mode)`; `isRunnerAlive(pid)` |
| `update-runner.ts` | the state machine run BY the spawned process: `runInstall` / `runRollback`, one command per step |
| `runner-command.ts` | one command's mechanics: argv spawn (no shell), framing into `job.log`, the 10-minute ceiling, the detail rule — used by `update-runner.ts` and by nothing else |

**Spawn** (`spawnUpdateRunner`, `update-job.ts`): `process.execPath` with the same tsx loader pair
`deploy/dev-supervisor/child.mjs` uses (`--require preflight.cjs`, `--import loader.mjs`) running
`update-runner.ts <dir> <install|rollback>`; `cwd: appRoot`; `detached: true`; `stdio: ['ignore',
logFd, logFd]` where `logFd` is `job.log` opened for append (closed in the parent once the child
holds it); env is `process.env` + `TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH`, with `CLOUDCLI_SUPERVISED` /
`CLOUDCLI_HANDOVER` deleted (a spawned command must not inherit a supervisor claim that isn't
this process's); `unref()`; returns the pid. The loader pair matters because through the tsx CLI
the returned pid would be tsx's, and `isRunnerAlive()` reads `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for the literal
substring `update-runner` — the CLI's cmdline wouldn't have it, so every live runner would read as
dead. The caller writes `runnerPid` into `job.json` itself (`createJob` → `spawnUpdateRunner` →
set `runnerPid` → `writeJob`); the runner's own first write is never the one that records its pid.

**Runner startup** (`update-runner.ts` `main`): argv `<dir> <install|rollback>`; a missing dir or
an unrecognised mode refuses (exit 1, one usage line, `job.json` untouched) BEFORE the job is even
read — a mistyped hand-run must not mark someone else's live job `failed`. Then `awaitJob` polls
`job.json` every 100ms (`JOB_POLL_MS`) for up to 10s (`JOB_WAIT_MS`) for `job.runnerPid ===
process.pid`; a job that never names this pid gets `the job never named this runner (pid <pid>)`
and exit 1, `job.json`/`job.log` untouched — the guard against a stray or duplicate spawn acting on
a job it doesn't own. Exit code is about the PROCESS, not the job: 0 once a verdict is on disk
(whatever it says), 1 only when the process never got that far.

**Install** (`runInstall`): runs the job's `cli`/`sdk` steps in `job.steps` order, one at a time; a
job with ZERO install steps throws `the job names no install step` (never a vacuous green
`installed`) — caught by `markTopLevelFailure`, which marks the job `failed` with `endedAt` set and
logs `the runner stopped: the job names no install step`. A failed step stops the run; later
install steps stay `pending` (the reconciler only advances a job out of `installed`, so nothing
would ever commit or restart what a further install changed). `installCli`: `npm install -g
<pkg>@<version>`; exit 0 is the whole verdict. `installSdk`: `npm install --save <pkg>@<version>`,
but landed means BOTH exit 0 AND `readSdkVersionOnDisk() === version` — npm can exit 0 having put
something else in place, and the restart that follows only has the disk to go on. On landing,
`job.packageFiles.hashesAfterInstall` is set to `hashPackageFiles(REPO_ROOT)` (INV-100's commit
guard reads this later — a file it can't re-read hashes to `''`, never a blind commit). On failure
the step is marked `failed`, `restoreSdk` runs (reinstalls the step's `from` version; if
`job.packageFiles.cleanAtStart`, also `git checkout HEAD -- package.json package-lock.json`; the
outcome is appended to the step's own detail as `; <version> restored` or a failure sentence), and
the `restart`/`commit` steps (when present) are marked `skipped` — `the SDK did not install`. Job
ends `installed` (**`endedAt` stays null** — not over, the reconciler restarts onto it next) when
every install step is `done`, else `failed` (`endedAt` set).

**Rollback** (`runRollback`): reinstalls the `sdk` step's `from` version and ends ON that step
(never a fresh one) — success marks the `commit` step `skipped` (`nothing to commit — Claude Agent
SDK <from> is back`) and the job `rolled-back`; failure (the npm install, or — when
`cleanAtStart` — the `git checkout` after it) marks the job `failed`, detail carrying `node_modules
may not match package-lock.json` after either failure's own message (git's own first stderr line
for the checkout, via `gitDetail`). No `sdk` step or no `from` on it: `nothing to roll back to: the
job does not name an Agent SDK version`, job `failed` at once — a rollback must never install a
guess. Rollback ALWAYS sets `endedAt`, on every branch (unlike install's `installed`).

**Running one command** (`runner-command.ts`, `runCommand(argv, cwd)`): argv spawn, never a shell.
`job.log` gets `[ISO] $ <argv joined>`, then one `[ISO] <line>` per output line (blank lines
dropped — npm pads with them), then `[ISO] exit <code|signal>`. `say()` is the single writer — this
process's own stdout IS `job.log` (the spawner opened it and handed it over as both stdout and
stderr), so runner lines and command lines interleave in true order. `COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` = 10
minutes: SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a 10s grace (`KILL_GRACE_MS`) if it's still alive — a timeout
is the verdict whatever the exit code says, and its detail (`npm did not finish within 10
minutes`) overrides npm's own last line. After the process's own `exit` event, `STREAM_DRAIN_MS` =
250ms is given before the verdict settles — an npm-spawned install-script grandchild can hold the
piped stdio open after npm itself is gone, and a verdict must never hang on that (`child.mjs` waits
out the same hazard with the same bound). A command that never started at all (nothing named on
PATH) is a FAILED command, not a runner crash: the framed verdict line reads `exit — the command
never started` (words, not `-2`, the bare libuv code) while `CommandResult.code`/`signal` keep the
raw values for any machine reader. `failureDetail`: the first line starting `npm error`, else the
last line printed, else `npm exited with <code|signal> and said nothing`. `gitDetail`: git's own
first stderr line, or the general detail when there isn't one.

**Any uncaught throw** during `runInstall`/`runRollback` is caught by `main` and handed to
`markTopLevelFailure`: whatever step is `running` is marked `failed` with the error's own message,
the job is marked `failed` with `endedAt` set, and `job.log` gets `the runner stopped: <message>` —
leaving the job in `installing` would have the reconciler read a dead runner as `interrupted`
(vanished), which is not what happened.

`spawnUpdateRunner`'s caller (`update-actions.service.ts`) and the reconciler that reads
`runnerPid`/`isRunnerAlive` (`update-reconciler.ts`) are MAN-7403 — the API-side half that starts,
watches and commits a job this file's process only ever runs.

governs: /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/modules/claude-updates/runner-command.ts, /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/modules/claude-updates/update-job.ts, /home/lyphe/.claude/claudecodeui_lyphe/server/modules/claude-updates/update-runner.ts

## MAN-7403 — The Claude update apply/restart — routes, actions, reconciler

The serving half of the install/restart pipeline (the detached runner process is MAN-7402; the
version check is MAN-7401): once a job exists, everything that starts it, watches it, restarts
onto it and commits it belongs to whichever API process holds the port. Six files, one question
each:

| file | owns |
|---|---|
| `claude-updates.routes.ts` | `POST /apply` and `POST /restart` (`GET /` and `POST /check` are MAN-7401's) |
| `update-actions.service.ts` | `applyUpdate` / `restartServer`: the ordered refusal checks, the burst guard |
| `update-reconciler.ts` | the tick: when a pass runs, one at a time, and dispatch by `job.state` |
| `update-reconciler.states.ts` | what `installed` and `restarting` DO: CLI verification, the reboot, the 4 ordered rules |
| `update-commit.ts` | the commit step's 4 guards, INV-100's pathspec rule, never pushed |
| `update-git.ts` | `GitResult`/`RunGit` — two type aliases only; the one `execFile` implementation lives in `claude-updates.module.ts` |

**`POST /apply`** (body `{ targets: { cli?, sdk? } }`): 400 `bad-request` when the body carries no
`targets` object; else `applyUpdate(targets)` — a refusal answers its own `status`/`refusal`
(400 or 409), a success re-reads and answers the full report at 202 (a job has started, not
finished — the tab polls this route from here on). **`POST /restart`**: `restartServer()`; a
refusal is 409 with `{error, message}`; success is 202 `{ requested: true }` — the process about
to be replaced cannot honestly say more than that.

**`applyUpdate`'s checks, in order** (`update-actions.service.ts`): shape (`readNamedTargets` —
only `cli`/`sdk` keys, each a string value, at least one) → the in-process `startingUpdate` flag
(409 `job-active` — closes a same-process burst: measured 2026-09-28, two `POST /apply` in one
burst both accepted and spawned two runners before this guard existed) → `job.json`'s own state
against `APPLY_ACTIVE_STATES` (`installing`, `installed`, `restarting`, `rolling-back`) →
`selectKind` against a FRESH check report (every target equals that package's `latest` now ⇒
`update`; every target equals the last `done` `update` job's own `from` ⇒ `rollback`; neither ⇒
409 `stale-target`) → the CLI's own `updatable` flag when `cli` is named (409 `not-updatable`) →
what is installed right now (a target already at the version asked for drops out; nothing left ⇒
409 `nothing-to-update`) → one more `job.json` read with **no `await` between it and `writeJob`**
(409 `job-active` again — this is the guard against the window the awaits above open: a job
written by another request, or another process across a handover, in that window is refused
rather than overwritten). `startingUpdate` is set before the first await and released in a
`finally`; a missed release would refuse every later press for the life of the process. The
`git diff --quiet` clean-at-start test only runs when `sdk` is among the remaining targets.
Write order is `createJob` → `spawnRunner('install')` → set `runnerPid` → `writeJob` →
`reconciler.kick()` — the runner waits for its own pid to appear in the file, never the reverse.

**`restartServer`**: 409 `not-supervised` when `supervised` is false; 409 `job-active` when
`job.state` is `installing` or `rolling-back` (`RESTART_ACTIVE_STATES` — the runner owns the tree
in those two); when the job is already `restarting`, records `job.restart = { requestedAt,
requestedBy: process.pid }` the same way the reconciler's own request is recorded, so a boot this
call triggers still rolls back on failure. `requestReboot()` answering false (the supervisor
channel closed between the check and the send) is 409 `not-supervised` too.

**The tick** (`update-reconciler.ts`, `TICK_INTERVAL_MS` = 1s): `start()` reads `job.json` once
and arms only for a non-terminal job; `kick()` arms it and no-ops before `start()`; a pass disarms
on a terminal job and, when the RUNNER was the one that ended it (`failed`/`rolled-back` reach a
terminal state without a pass of this file's), fires `runCheck()` once — the one memory the tick
keeps, so the panel does not wait out the cadence to see a version the runner already moved
(`TERMINAL_STATES`: `done`, `failed`, `rolled-back`, `interrupted`). One pass at a time (`busy`);
nothing runs before `isListening()`. `installing`/`rolling-back` with a dead runner
(`isRunnerAlive` false) → `interrupted`, the running step marked `failed` — a spinner over a dead
runner is a lie a person waits on. `installed`/`restarting` are handed to
`update-reconciler.states.ts`.

**`installed`** (`update-reconciler.states.ts`): verifies the `cli` step by reading the binary a
run would spawn and comparing it to `step.to`; a `cli`-only job ends there (`done`/`failed`, no
restart owed). An `sdk` step routes to the `restart` step: already on the loaded version (a
restart happened between the install and this pass) skips straight to the commit; else
`requestReboot()` — accepted moves the job to `restarting` and records
`{ requestedAt, requestedBy: process.pid }`; refused (`!supervised`) still moves the job to
`restarting`, the step's own sentence saying a person must restart it by hand.

**`restarting`**, four rules in order: (1) this process already loaded the target version → the
restart is done, run the commit, finish `done`; (2) a request of THIS process's own, unanswered
past `REBOOT_ANSWER_TIMEOUT_MS` (60s) → put the step back to `pending` for another press; (3)
another process booted AFTER the request (`performance.timeOrigin > requestedAt`) and loaded
something else → that boot WAS the answer and it was wrong → `failed`; (4) anything else (a boot
already in flight, a requester this process will never see again) → leave the job exactly as it
is. `rebootFailed` (the supervisor's failure listener) answers only a `restarting` job whose
`requestedBy` is this process's own pid: the `restart` step gets the supervisor's own error line,
the job moves to `rolling-back`, and `spawnRunner('rollback')` + `writeJob` + `arm()` happen in
one call — a failed boot always ends in a runner, never a job left stuck waiting.

**`update-commit.ts`'s four guards, in order**: no `commit` step on the job → throws (unreachable
from typed callers — only an sdk job carries one); `packageFiles.cleanAtStart` false → `skipped`
("had uncommitted changes when the update started"); `hashesAfterInstall` null or either hash
changed since the runner wrote it → `skipped` ("changed after the install"); else
`git commit -m <message> -- package.json package-lock.json` (INV-100 — the pathspec form commits
the FULL working-tree content of exactly those two paths, which is what the two guards above exist
to make safe) → `failed` on a non-zero exit (git's own first stderr line) or `done` (a
`rev-parse --short HEAD` for the receipt — a failed rev-parse costs the sentence its hash, never
the step its `done`). The commit runs with the repository's own hooks and is never pushed. Message:
`chore(deps): bump <sdk name> from <X> to <Y>` for an update, `roll back …` for a rollback — both
versions are the step's own, not whatever happens to be on disk when it runs.

**`claude-updates.module.ts`** builds the one `runGit` (`execFile('git', argv, { cwd: appRoot })`,
never rejecting — a git that ran and refused answers with its own code and words; only a git that
could not start at all answers `code: null`) and hands the same function to the commit, the
actions and the reconciler, so nothing here grows a second implementation of "ask git something."
`stop()` stops the reconciler along with the check (MAN-7401) — a shutdown owes nothing to a job
the runner still holds, and the next process reads the same file.

**`server/index.ts`'s global error middleware** answers a body `express.json()` could not parse
(`type: 'entity.parse.failed'` / `'entity.too.large'`) before the `AppError` branch, with one
`console.warn` line instead of a raw stack: `/api/claude-updates` gets `{error:'bad-request',
message}` — the shape its own routes use for every other refusal — while every other route keeps
the app's `{success:false,error:{code:'BAD_REQUEST',…}}` envelope. Without this a truncated body
on `/apply` or `/restart` answered 500 `INTERNAL_ERROR` (measured 2026-09-28). A future route
wanting the `/api/claude-updates` refusal shape has to join that path's own prefix branch; every
other route keeps the envelope.

## MAN-7404 — The Claude update client

The live frontend half of the Claude update pipeline (the wire contract is MAN-7401; the
install/restart backend is MAN-7402/MAN-7403): `src/modules/claude-updates/`, composed from Verve
primitives, wired into Settings and the sidebar. All three surfaces read the one module-scope report
in `hooks/useClaudeUpdates.ts`, and every call goes out through `src/shared/api.ts`'s `claudeUpdates`
group — `GET /api/claude-updates`, `POST /api/claude-updates/{check,apply,restart}`.

| file | owns |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | the module's whole export surface: `ClaudeUpdatesSettingsTab`, `ClaudeUpdateFooterRow`, `ClaudeUpdateRailButton` |
| `hooks/useClaudeUpdates.ts` | the client contract: `{ report, refresh, check, apply, restart }`; `isUpdateJobActive(job)` — true on `installing`/`installed`/`restarting`/`rolling-back`; and the one module-scope report with its poller |
| `ClaudeUpdatesSettingsTab.tsx` | Settings → Updates: title (drawn even before the first report, with the one Try again press), clock line + Check now, one `PackageUpdateCard` per package, the actions row, `UpdateJobPanel`, the last press's refusal |
| `PackageUpdateCard.tsx` | one package: state line, `reason`, SDK `loaded` line, CLI mid-turn plural line, Roll back |
| `PatchNotes.tsx` | the notes list under a card |
| `UpdateJobPanel.tsx` | the four steps with icon + `from → to` + detail, `logTail` folded |
| `ClaudeUpdateFooterRow.tsx` | `ClaudeUpdateFooterRow` (sidebar footer row) + `ClaudeUpdateRailButton` (collapsed rail icon), both off one `useUpdatesFooterLine` hook |
| `updateWording.ts` | `UPDATE_STEP_LABELS`, `JOB_STATE_SENTENCES` — one place, because both the job panel and the footer row draw them |

**One report, one poller.** Every surface subscribes to the single module-scope slot; the read's
cadence follows the report's own `job` — 60 s idle, 1.5 s while `isUpdateJobActive(job)`, the timer
re-armed when that changes — and nothing is published until the body changes, so a poll answering
the same bytes moves no renderer. A failed read keeps the last picture. Each action posts and then
forces a read, resolving `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, message }` — the refusal's own sentence
(`ClaudeUpdateRefusal`, 400/409) drawn under the buttons that asked; `refresh()` is that forced read
on its own, answering true/false.

**Rules**:
- `updateAvailable` is never re-derived client-side — `PackageUpdateCard` only draws the server's
  own reading (`installed` vs `latest`, the CLI's own ordering).
- "Available" (an offer drawn) = `updateAvailable && updatable && latest !== null`; an update that
  exists but is not `updatable` draws the plain pair plus `reason`, never a button.
- Roll back shows only when `job.kind === 'update' && job.state === 'done'` and this package's own
  step is `done`; it sends `{ targets: { [pkg.key]: step.from } }` — one package at a time.
- `Restart server` is drawn only while `report.supervised` — a process that cannot hand itself over
  offers no restart.
- The under-buttons sentence is drawn only while `versions.length > 0` (an offer exists); there is
  no fallback copy for "nothing on offer".
- The CLI card's mid-turn count is `useCliVersion().staleSessionIds.size` — this module never reads
  `/api/cli-version` itself (MAN-503).
- `en/settings.json` carries no `updates.*` keys; every string in this module ships its own English
  `defaultValue` (`updateWording.ts`'s own note) — do not add a parallel `updates` i18n block
  without moving these off `defaultValue` at the same time.

**Wired into (additive, no renames)**: `src/shared/types.ts` (`SettingsMainTab` gains `'updates'`),
`src/shared/constants.ts` (`SETTINGS_MAIN_TABS` — the command **palette's** own ordered list; it is
**not** the sidebar's list — `SettingsSidebar.tsx` keeps its own `NAV_ITEMS`, and the two are kept
in step by hand, no shared source, both carrying `updates` just before `about`),
`useSettingsController.ts` (`KNOWN_MAIN_TABS`), `Settings.tsx` (renders `ClaudeUpdatesSettingsTab`
on `activeTab === 'updates'`), `useProjectsState.ts` (`onShowUpdates: () => openSettings('updates')`),
threaded through `Sidebar.tsx` → `SidebarCollapsed.tsx`/`SidebarContent.tsx` →
`SidebarFooter.tsx`/`SidebarCollapsed.tsx` as one more prop, mirroring `onShowSettings`.

## MAN-7416 — server/modules/agent-launch — the relay's service, shape checks, failure classes and timeouts

Module internals of the `/api/agent-launch` relay. Its contract (routes, bodies, refused 400 · unreachable 503 · unreadable 502, `LAUNCH_TABLE_BIN`) is MAN-7418; Metis's resolve is a section of MAN-7418; the window that reads it is MAN-7417. The server never opens `launch.toml` and never regenerates a shim; the CLI is the one reader and writer (MAN-7415, MAN-7407).

## service
| what | value |
|---|---|
| instance | one `createAgentLaunchService({ bin })`, built on first use, shared by the router and `resolveLaunchSide` |
| `resolveLaunchSide(name, side)` | barrel export; runs `resolve <name> --side <side>` through the same service; answers `AgentLaunchResolved` `{name, side, model, effort}` |
| spawn | `execFile` with argv (no shell), `cwd` = `os.homedir()`, env = `userFacingEnv()`, stdout cap 4 MiB |

## route checks — shape only
| check | value |
|---|---|
| row name | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`; a shape, not a soul whitelist |
| word (model, effort, model key) | `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_.-]{0,63}$`; a token fence, not the vocabulary — `-` first would read as a CLI flag |
| unknown body key | 400 |
| `effort` map | at most 16 models (`EFFORT_MAP_MAX_ENTRIES`); more would overrun the OS argv limit; `{}` counts as no field |
| no field named | 400 "name at least one of …" |

Which words the table accepts is the CLI's to say; its sentence reaches the caller.

## failure classes
Every failure is `AgentLaunchResult` `{ok: false, reason, message}`; the status each reason earns is MAN-7418.
| reason | when |
|---|---|
| `refused` | exit 2 with `{"error": "<sentence>"}` on stdout; the sentence passes untouched. The CLI's own argparse faults are refusals too |
| `unreachable` | spawn failure (`ENOENT`), timeout, crash, any other exit, exit 2 with no `{"error"}` on stdout |
| `unreadable` | exit 0 whose stdout is not one JSON object; a `resolveSide` answer whose `name`, `side`, `model` or `effort` does not match what was asked |

| verb | timeout |
|---|---|
| `show`, `resolve` | 20 s (`READ_TIMEOUT_MS`) |
| `set`, `defaults` | 90 s (`WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`): the CLI's lock wait plus the 60 s regeneration |

An error thrown outside these branches goes to the app's error handler.

## shared types — `server/shared/types.ts`
`AgentLaunchResult<T>` · `AgentLaunchResolved` · `AgentLaunchRowChange` · `AgentLaunchDefaultsChange`.

The client mirror is `src/shared/agent-launch-types.ts`: the census key for key in the CLI's snake_case, plus `AgentLaunchRowChange` and `AgentLaunchDefaultsChange`.

## MAN-7425 — SettingRow — the one settings row, its wrap rule and its probe

## `SettingRow` — `src/shared/ui/SettingRow.tsx`

One labelled setting and its control. Exported from `src/shared/ui/index.ts`. Every Settings tab, `LanguageSelector`, the heal panel's settings dialog (`HealControls.tsx`), the plugin cards (`PluginSettingsTab.tsx`, inside the card's accent-bar chrome) and the MCP server rows (`McpServers.tsx`) compose it.

| prop | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `label` | the row's title, `break-words`: a string, or nodes when the title carries marks that must wrap with its words (a plugin's version and slot, an MCP server's transport and scope, a status badge) |
| `icon?` | mark before the label, in a `flex shrink-0` slot |
| `description?` | helper under the label: a string, or nodes for a byline and links |
| `children` | the control; `null` draws no control wrapper at all |
| other attributes | land on the root (`data-*` hooks) |

### Layout rules

| rule | why |
| --- | --- |
| The row wraps; the layout follows the ROW's width, never the viewport. No `sm:` breakpoint on a row. | The Settings modal and the heal dialog differ in width at one viewport; a breakpoint gets one wrong. |
| Text column is `min-w-[min(100%,10rem)] flex-1`; controls are `max-w-full shrink-0`. Controls sit beside the text while a 10rem column fits, else drop below it. | Without a floor the text column got the remainder: 1px beside a stepper + ghost button + switch at 360px, label spilling under the controls. |
| Floor is 10rem. Switch-only rows stay inline at 320, 341, 357, 360 and 390px at 1.0× and 1.072× text scale, and from 357px at 1.2×. | Measured 2026-09-29. 13rem dropped every switch row below its text at 320 (208 + 16 + 52 > 254px) and was too wide at the operator's 1.072× text scale (fix-pass M1). 9rem also holds 341px at 1.2×. |
| A switch-only row seen dropping below its text near 341–360px: lower the floor. Steppers, buttons, inputs and badges drop below their text by design. | |
| Icon slot never shrinks, label span is `min-w-0`. No caller patches a glyph. | A wrapping label squeezed a bare icon to nothing. |
| A fixed-width field carries `max-w-full` (`w-64 max-w-full`, `NtfySettingsCard.tsx` `FIELD_WIDTH`). No `w-full sm:w-*` workaround. | Both were patches for the squeeze the floor now handles. |
| `null` children ⇒ no wrapper. | An empty `shrink-0` wrapper takes its own flex line and adds a blank band under the text (Jev's scope rows). |
| A status badge rides the label line, with `null` children (`AccountContent`'s Connected badge). | In the controls slot the floor treats a badge like a button and drops it under the text at 320px. |

### Proof — `.verify/probe-settings-rows.mjs`

```bash
node .verify/probe-settings-rows.mjs <before|after>
```

The measurers live in `.verify/lib/settings-rows-measure.mjs` (run inside the page), the walk, stubs and drivers in `.verify/lib/settings-rows-walk.mjs`.

| item | value |
| --- | --- |
| Word | prefixes shots: `.verify/shots/settings-rows-<word>-<place>-<viewport>-x<scale>-<theme>.png` |
| `SETTINGS_ROWS_WIDTHS` | comma list of CSS px, default `320,360,390,1440`; under 768 is a phone |
| `SETTINGS_ROWS_SCALES` | comma list of text scales, default `1,1.072` (the operator's phone draws text at 1.072×; the root font size is set, as Android's font scale does) |
| `SETTINGS_ROWS_CLIENT` | URL of a `vite preview` of a pre-change build, to measure `before` after the tree moved on |
| Finds rows | by shape (flex box of two children: text, then a control or a status pill, beside a column that takes the slack), never by class or component name |
| Measures | text-column width; control over a label/description/icon line box (overlap); control past the row or pane edge (overflow); the column's ink past its own edge (spill); ANY text past its own column, in a row or not (overrun — the MCP URL); a switch-only row or a status pill below its text at a phone width (dropped); a pill set into a label's line below the words it follows; a control cut by the box that hides it (cut — its box leaves an `overflow: hidden` ancestor's or the pane's; a scroller passes): the plugin install form's button behind its input, the uninstall banner's Remove |
| Provider strip | measured on the Agents tab at every walk and once more at 768 × 1.2×: no provider button clipped by an `overflow: hidden` ancestor, none truncated, the last one reachable when the strip scrolls |
| Tab resize | opens Settings at 1440, picks a tab, crosses to 700, reads the tab and whether the pane node survived; then the same from a second tab back to 1440; then a phone turned to landscape and back (390×844 ↔ 844×390), the tab picked in portrait |
| Stubs | swarm ceiling set; TaskMaster installed; two installed plugins (the box has none; one with a 52-character name) — each answered locally, and the walk presses the first card's uninstall to draw its confirm banner, then Cancel; the box's user-scope MCP list gets a long-URL server and a long-stdio server (long command, args, env, cwd) added (a GET, answered from the real reply); every non-GET to preferences and settings is answered locally |
| Verdict | last line `settings-rows=pass` (exit 0) or `settings-rows=fail` (exit 1); usage error exits 2 |
| Baseline 2026-09-29, round 2 | before: plugin cards' text column 122–135px at 320 and the repo slug running out of it; MCP URLs 14–382px past their column at 320–390, 6px at 1440; the Connected badge below its text at 320; OpenCode clipped at 768 × 1.2; the open tab reset to Agents on every crossing of 768. After: 0 overlaps, 0 overflows, 0 overruns, 0 dropped switches or badges at 320/360/390 × 1.0/1.072, the plugin cards' column 246px at 320, the strip scrolls with every provider reachable, tab and pane kept across both crossings |
| Not covered | the heal stepper value wrapping to two lines at 360 (no overlap) |

## MAN-7426 — Lightbox — the one full-screen zoom viewer for pictures and diagrams

`src/shared/ui/Lightbox.tsx` + `src/shared/ui/useZoomPan.ts`: the one full-screen zoom viewer.

- Callers: `ImageLightbox` (`src/modules/chat/transcript/ChatMessageImages.tsx`; thumbnails, composer attachments, file previews) and `MermaidDiagram` (the chat's mermaid fence and a markdown preview).
- In the kit because chat and markdown-preview cannot import each other.
- `Lightbox` is exported from `src/shared/ui/index.ts`; `useZoomPan` is not, as with `usePointerDrag`.
- `ImageLightbox` is a thin `<img>` wrapper; `MermaidDiagram`'s `DiagramViewer` passes an opaque card, because mermaid's light theme draws dark ink the backdrop would swallow.

## Lightbox — inputs

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| open | fitted (scale 1) |
| wheel; trackpad pinch (`ctrl`+wheel) | zoom about the pointer |
| two-finger pinch | zoom about the midpoint; a drifting pinch also pans |
| drag | pan, clamped so no empty backdrop shows on an axis the content overflows |
| double-click; double-tap | toggle fit and 2× |
| `+` `−` buttons; keys `+` `-` `0` | step ×1.5 about the centre; fit |
| Esc; close button; click on the backdrop | close |
| click on the content; the click ending a pan or pinch; a press begun on a control and released on the backdrop | never closes |

## Lightbox — rules

- Zoom runs fit (1×) to 8×. It is a CSS transform on the content, so an svg redraws sharp at every level. No `will-change: transform`: it pins the raster and blurs an svg.
- The viewer is a native modal `<dialog>` opened by `showModal()` in a layout effect, in the browser's TOP LAYER. No fixed layer (the PRD editor's `z-[200]`, Settings' `z-[9999]`, a later one) can cover it, and it carries no z-index. Anything that must sit above it has to be top-layer itself.
- `showModal()` makes the page inert, focuses the close button and keeps Tab inside. Focus returns to the opener on close. The dialog's `cancel` is prevented: Esc is heard from window capture, so closing never stops a run.
- A `ResizeObserver` on the stage and the content re-clamps the pan on a window resize or a phone turning.
- A `ctrl`+wheel delta is capped at 25px per event: a Ctrl+mouse-wheel notch lands near a plain one (about 1.28× against 1.25×), not 2.7×. A pinch, many small deltas, is unaffected.
- `useZoomPan` hears moves and releases on the WINDOW, never through pointer capture: capture retargets the `click` that ends a press, and the overlay needs the click's real target to tell the backdrop from the content.
- Double-tap is two taps within 320ms and 32px; a touch screen sends no `dblclick`.
- Controls carry `data-lightbox-control`; a capture handler records whether a press began on one, and the overlay's click ignores such a press.
- The toolbar is centred with `inset-x-0 mx-auto w-fit`, never `-translate-x-1/2`: on a touch screen `src/index.css` gives a tapped `button` `transform: inherit !important`, so a button inside a translated parent jumps half its width between press and release and the click misses.
- The same rule gives a tapped `[role="button"]` `background-color: inherit !important`: `MermaidDiagram`'s button carries no paint and the card is its child.
- The close button and the toolbar are `absolute`, so the PWA inset rides their offsets (`--safe-area-inset-*`), not the layer's `pwa-notch-safe` padding.
- Not handled: Safari's desktop trackpad pinch, which arrives as `gesture*` events.

## Lightbox — MermaidDiagram

- A drawn diagram is a `role="button"` (`cursor-zoom-in`; Enter and Space too) that opens `Lightbox` on a card sized to fit the screen, capped at 2× the diagram's natural size. A diagram shown as its source never opens.
- The viewer's svg copy has every element id renamed with a `viewer-` PREFIX, because the inline diagram stays in the page behind it and sequence diagrams use ids (`actor14`, `root-15`) that are not scoped to the root id.
- Prefix, never suffix: mermaid's stylesheet picks markers out by the END of their id (`[id$="-crosshead"]`, `-barbEnd`, `-arrowhead`); nothing in it selects by the start.

## Lightbox — strings and probes

- Strings: `common.lightbox.*` (`close`, `zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `fit`) and `common.shapes.diagram`, `common.shapes.diagramOpen`; all 11 locales. The close label is `Close preview` in `en`.
- `.verify/lightbox-zoom.mjs [label] [phase ...]`: desktop and a 390px phone, dark and light; a diagram, a picture, the markdown-preview path; sends no message.
- `.verify/pwa-notch-close-controls.mjs`: the close button clears the notch; it pins `userLanguage: 'en'` through `prefs-pin` to find the button by its label.
